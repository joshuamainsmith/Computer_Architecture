A short project where I teach myself basic principles in front end development. Here I practice learning the basics of HTML and CSS. I plan on adding more to the page once I become more familiar with other aspects of web dev.

From The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101/html-css)
